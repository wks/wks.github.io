<p>I am very sad to heard about the death of <a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, our collaborator.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> generously sponsored the <a href="https://www.mmtk.io/">MMTk</a> project to develop <a href="https://github.com/mmtk/mmtk-ruby">mmtk-ruby</a>, a VM
binding that enables <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> to use MMTk as its garbage collector, and Chris has
been the person actively working with us.  Over the past few years, he has
provided support for Angus Atkinson, the initial developer of mmtk-ruby, and me
who continued the development of mmtk-ruby after Angus.  Although we never met
in person, I received great help from him during regular online meetings. He
helped me getting familiar with the Ruby runtime with which I had no prior
experience, and provided suggestions handling impedance mismatches between MMTk
and Ruby.  While I focused on getting MMTk to work, he helped with adding
MMTk-related version flags, command-line options and other ergonomics.  He fixed
tests and set up a nightly build server.  He helped identifying bugs in MMTk and
its API.  He also helped promoting our project, letting the community know our
effort of improving Ruby with a powerful GC framework.</p>

<p>Sadly, Chris is no longer with us.  It is a great loss for the MMTk project as
well as the whole programming language and virtual machine community.</p>
